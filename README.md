## About VIMMI

### Objectives

The Intelligent Multimodal Interfaces group does research in novel user interaction paradigms and applications for Design and Manufacturing applications. We have focused our activities on Calligraphic Interfaces. These are applications organized around drawing and sketching as the main paradigms. We also work on other interaction modalities such as speech, sound and vision.

### Strategy

The Visualization and Intelligent Multimodal Interfaces group, at INESC-ID (Lisbon, Portugal), works on:

* Multimodal Interfaces

* Visualization and Simulation

* Multimedia Information Retrieval and Visualization

* Personal Information Management

* Accessibility and Mobile Computing
